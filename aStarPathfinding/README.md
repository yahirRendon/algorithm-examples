<h1 align="center">A * Search/Pathfinding</h1>

<p align="center">
  The A * Search alogrithm is used to find the shortest paths between two points. This is a basic example using a grid of cells and two movers, a start and target. Additionally, movement is only considered for left, right, up, and down movements with the grid of cells. Additionally, some visualization is used to demonstrate the algorithm.  
</p>

## To Do
<p>- Use diagnoal movements as well. 
<br>- Allow users to create their own walls.
</p>
 
## Demo
<p>- A visual of the layout.
<br>- A function sets the position of the image according to the time to mimic sun rising and setting</p>

</p>

##  Instructions
<p>- ARROW KEYS move the target mover object
<br>- SPACE KEY reset the start mover object
</p>

## Usage Notes
<p>- Processing 4.5.4
<br>- Ensure the .pde file is contained within a folder of the exact same name
