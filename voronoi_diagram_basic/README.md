<h1 align="center">Voronoi Diagram</h1>

<p align="center">
A Voronoi diagram is a way of partitioning a plane around a set of nodes most often randomly scatted to create polygons. The key feature of a voronoi diagram and its algorthmic implementation is that ever point within a polygon is closest to the origin node over any other node. 
</p>

# To Do
<p>- Find different implementations as my implementation is not the most optimized in that it requires checking each point as it expands. This can be neat for animation purposes but suffers in speed. I would like to find a way to identify the cell or polygon vertices withou. 
<br>- explore the relationship between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triagulation. In my research this came up. 
<br>- do an implementation that distorts an image. 
</p>
 
## Demo
<p>- A visual of the layout.
<br>- A function sets the position of the image according to the time to mimic sun rising and setting</p>

##  Instructions
<p>- SPACE KEY begins the Voronoi diagram animation
<br>- R KEY to clear canvas and reset nodes
